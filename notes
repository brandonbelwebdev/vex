To-Do Breakdown

Design the Search UI
Position it top-center on the job board section
Use rounded, dark-glass aesthetic (like Groq)
Placeholder text: "Search job titles, cities, or skills..."
Connect to Airtable
Use Airtable API (your existing view is already set)
Pull data via JavaScript fetch call
Store all entries in memory for real-time filtering
Implement Filter Logic
On each keystroke (input event), filter entries by:
job_title
location
keywords (if available)
Display filtered results below dynamically
Build Render Function
Clean card-style layout per job
Show title, company, city, and apply link
Animate or fade in new results smoothly
Error Handling
If no results: show “No jobs found, try another keyword”
If Airtable fetch fails: console log + user-friendly fallback
